Capstone Project: Battle of the Neighbourhoods

Introduction and Business Problem

Business Question: Where to build new apartment complex in the city of Toronto, Canada?

An American property management company (‘City Living Limited’) is looking to build a new 
apartment complex building in one of the neighbourhoods in Toronto, Canada. 
The company has been approached by an investor (and shareholder in the company), who wants 
to invest 40% in a new building project in Toronto. The investor has explained that he wants 
the new apartment complex to be built in a neighbourhood that lies within a Toronto-named Borough 
(in other words, in a borough that includes the name ‘Toronto’ – for example, West Toronto, Downtown Toronto, etc.).  
The company would have to invest the remaining 60% into the new property development.

After meeting with key stakeholders and upper management executives, the main requirements for the 
location of the new building are: it must be near amenities (shops, restaurants, etc.) and be in a 
Toronto-named borough. The accessibility to local trendy venues is extremely important, as the property 
market is highly competitive, especially in a popular city like Toronto. City Living Limited will be spending 
a significant amount on building this new property, and it’s critical that they find the right location with 
the highest profitability. Building in a foreign country (even one just across the border) requires building 
and planning permission, legal fees, and the cost of flights from New York to Toronto for planning meetings and 
overseeing development. This would be a very expensive project.

As a Data Analyst, I have been tasked with assessing whether the neighbourhoods of Toronto-named boroughs would 
be a good investment decision or too risky. The company has informed me that they recently built a property in the 
trendy neighbourhood of Marble Hill, Manhattan (New York). As such, they believe that finding a similar location in Toronto 
would be a good start in locating a new building site.

II & III. Data and Methodology 

Data Requirements: 
Understanding the business problem and knowing what to look for in the datasets (I’ll need post codes, neighbourhood names, 
borough names, using Foursquare API credentials to gather location information). 

Data Collection:
Before exploring the Toronto borough and neighbourhood data, I will first explore the neighbourhood of Marble Hill, Manhattan. 
I will upload and read the Manhattan data (through a json file), build a dataframe using pandas and create map visualisations 
with folium and other necessary libraries (see github notebook for further details).  I will parse and scrape a wikipedia page 
with Toronto postal codes and neighbourhood data, in order to build a dataframe, create map visualisations, and make Foursquare 
API calls. 

Data Understanding:
I will be building dataframes from the data sets, then cleaning the data, should there be any entry errors or null values. 

Data Preparation:
I will use a combination of SQL queries within python to analyse top venues in Marble Hill, in order to better understand 
what to look for in the Toronto data. 

I will use Foursquare API to gather venue information regarding Marble Hill, which will then be used in comparison to the 
Toronto data. This will allow me to see which (if any) neighbourhoods in Toronto-named boroughs are the best fit for the 
company’s new project.
