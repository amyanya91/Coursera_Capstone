Capstone Project: Battle of the Neighbourhoods

Introduction and Business Problem

Business Question: Where to build new apartment complex in the city of Toronto, Canada?

A property management company (‘City Living Limited’) is looking to build a new apartment complex building in one of the neighbourhoods 
in Toronto, Canada, but only neighbourhoods that contain ‘Toronto’ in the name (i.e. Downtown Toronto). 

After meeting with key stakeholders and upper management executives, the main requirements 
for the location of the new building are that it must be near amenities (shops, restaurants, transportation), 
and be a trendy place. This is especially important, as the property market is highly competitive, 
especially in a popular city like Toronto. City Living Limited will be spending a significant amount on building this new property, 
and it’s critical that they find the right location with the highest profitability.

As a Data Analyst, I will be assisting the property management company with locating the best 
neighbourhood in which to build a new apartment building. 
Using Foursquare API, I will investigate the neighbourhoods that include the name ‘Toronto’, 
in order to find out which neighbourhood provides the best investment for this company’s newest building site.
