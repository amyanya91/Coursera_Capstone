Capstone Project: Battle of the Neighbourhoods

Introduction and Business Problem

Business Question: Where to build new apartment complex in the city of Toronto, Canada?

An American property management company (‘City Living Limited’) is looking to build a new 
apartment complex building in one of the neighbourhoods in Toronto, Canada. 
The company has been approached by an investor (and shareholder in the company), who wants 
to invest 40% in a new building project in Toronto. The investor has explained that he wants 
the new apartment complex to be built in a neighbourhood that lies within a Toronto-named Borough 
(in other words, in a borough that includes the name ‘Toronto’ – for example, West Toronto, Downtown Toronto, etc.).  
The company would have to invest the remaining 60% into the new property development.

After meeting with key stakeholders and upper management executives, the main requirements for the 
location of the new building are: it must be near amenities (shops, restaurants, etc.) and be in a 
Toronto-named borough. The accessibility to local trendy venues is extremely important, as the property 
market is highly competitive, especially in a popular city like Toronto. City Living Limited will be spending 
a significant amount on building this new property, and it’s critical that they find the right location with 
the highest profitability. Building in a foreign country (even one just across the border) requires building 
and planning permission, legal fees, and the cost of flights from New York to Toronto for planning meetings and 
overseeing development. This would be a very expensive project.

As a Data Analyst, I have been tasked with assessing whether the neighbourhoods of Toronto-named boroughs would 
be a good investment decision or too risky. The company has informed me that they recently built a property in the 
trendy neighbourhood of Marble Hill, Manhattan (New York). As such, they believe that finding a similar location in Toronto 
would be a good start in locating a new building site.
